> **dyna**mic **re**adme.md to **in**dex.html

File `index.html` will display `README.md` file content. This is based on a [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) and take advantage of [GitHub Markup](https://github.com/github/markup).

## Advantage
Maintain only `README.md` using simple markdown ([Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)) and get a simple website as well.

## Disadvantage
It is not [Progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) solution. But there is sort of fallback provided.
